# Solana DePIN & Tokenomics Consulting  
### by Ashish Homkar

> Consulting Web3 projects with **Tokenomics & Tokenization** for long-term sustainability — with a strong focus on **Solana** and **DePIN** (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks).

## 👋 About

I’m **Ashish Homkar**, a Web3 & Solana-focused consultant helping founders and teams design:

- Sustainable **token economies**
- Real-world, utility-driven **DePIN models**
- Robust **Solana-based infrastructure & tools**

The goal: **long-term value creation**, not just short-term hype.

## 🧩 What I Do

### 1. Tokenomics & Token Design
- Full **tokenomics architecture** (supply, emissions, unlocks, incentives)
- **Utility design** for DePIN, DeFi, and consumer apps
- **Vesting models**, lockups, and anti-dump mechanisms
- Simulation of **different scenarios** (growth, stress, bear/bull cycles)

### 2. Tokenization Strategy
- Mapping **real-world value → on-chain tokens**
- Designing **points / credits / utility tokens** that can evolve into tokens
- Frameworks for **token + product alignment**
- Compliance-aware structuring (high level, non-legal)

### 3. Solana & DePIN Development Support
- Architecture guidance for **Solana programs** (Rust, Anchor)
- Design patterns for **DePIN data + payments** on Solana
- Support for building:
  - Usage tracking & metering
  - Reward distribution logic
  - On-chain / off-chain data pipelines
- Integrations with common **Solana tooling** & infra

### 4. Tools & Internal Frameworks
- Custom **dashboards, scripts, and internal tools** to:
  - Track token emissions and circulating supply
  - Monitor on-chain metrics relevant to your token
  - Align business KPIs with token performance

## 🔗 Solana DePIN Focus

I work specifically with projects that are:

- Building **real-world infrastructure** (IoT, connectivity, sensors, compute, DePIN devices, etc.)
- Using **Solana** for:
  - Fast, low-cost micropayments
  - On-chain proofs (usage, uptime, data quality)
  - Reward distribution to nodes / devices / contributors

Example areas:
- Telecom & connectivity networks  
- Sensor networks (air quality, environment, mobility, etc.)  
- Compute / storage / bandwidth marketplaces

## 🎯 Engagement Model

I usually engage in one or more of the following formats:

- **Tokenomics Audit** – review your current model and suggest improvements  
- **Zero-to-One Design** – design tokenomics and Solana architecture from scratch  
- **Ongoing Advisory** – monthly/quarterly advisory for roadmap, launches, and updates  
- **Builder Support** – working closely with your dev team to convert tokenomics into **on-chain logic** and tools

## 🚀 Ideal Projects to Work With

I’m a good fit if you are:

- Building on **Solana** or planning to migrate to Solana
- Working on **DePIN**, infra, or real-world utility use cases
- Serious about **long-term sustainability**, not just listing & hype
- Ready to **ship** and iterate fast
